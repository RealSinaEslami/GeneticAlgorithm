## Traveling Salesman Problem & Genetic Algorithm

Genetic algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They mimic the evolutionary 1  process, where the fittest individuals survive and reproduce, passing on their beneficial traits to the next generation. This iterative approach allows genetic algorithms to explore vast solution spaces and find near-optimal solutions to complex problems.

Key Concepts:

Population: A group of potential solutions to the problem, each represented as a chromosome or individual.
Fitness Function: Evaluates the quality of each individual in the population, determining its likelihood of survival and reproduction.
Selection: The process of choosing individuals from the current population to become parents for the next generation.
Crossover: Combines the genetic material of two parents to create offspring, introducing genetic diversity.
Mutation: Randomly alters the genetic material of an individual, potentially creating new solutions.

All functions are implemented and they are able to become personalized for other problems and application
